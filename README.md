This webpage is a work hour schedular. User can schedule their work time from 9am to 8pm.
Users can write their plans in the input box located next to the time. 
Also, users can save their work schedule by clicking lock emoji button.
Every plans written in input box will be saved. 
If users want to refresh their plan, they can refresh the scheduler by clicking lock emoji button twice.
The background color of list is skyblue, but it will change to grey if the time is passed.
Only upcoming plans are shown in skyblue.

1. Right now, one save button works with every lines of planner. It needs to be changed to work one to one.
